A library of the core functionality of zerobuilder.
It is intended for use in other annotation processors.

### Caution

Work in progress!

### Usage

See tests in [module-builder](../modules/module-builder), [module-updater](../modules/module-updater) etc.

### State of affairs

This project contains mostly data type definitions, for the modules to work with.
Some technical debt has been piling up near `GoalContextFactory`. 
Also, there are probably <em>too many</em> types.
